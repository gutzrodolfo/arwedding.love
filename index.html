<h1> Rodolfo Guti√©rrez </h1> 

<h2> US Citizen, B.S. Computer Engineering </h2> 

I am a recent Computer Engineering graduate from California State University, San Bernardino. My concentration is in high performance and embedded systems.

My primary interests within the scope of my technical background are in software development, feedback control systems and the design and implementation of finite state machines, however, I am passionate about any creative application of specialized scientific and mathematical knowledge.

Some of my most rewarding learning experiences have come through collaborative projects. I look forward to a career in a team environment with like-minded individuals who share my level of interest for solving problems.s
