This page will be updated periodically with projects I've worked on independently or have contributed to. 

<h2> RISC vs. CISC </h2>

During the fall 2013 quarter, I worked collaboratively with a professor within the School of Computer Science & Engineering at my university to study the effects of RISC and CISC instruction set architectures on the energy consumption of contemporary mobile micro-processors. 

Conclusion: Neither instruction set architecture is inherently more or less energy efficient. The significance of the
ISA appears to simply be an engineering design preference aimed at achieving different levels of performance. Significant energy consumption differences between RISC & CISC ISAs are attributed to microarchitecture differences.

<h2> SDL Implementation on iOS and OSX </h2>

During the spring 2014 quarter, I worked extensively with one of my professors on the implementation and packaging for release of cross-platform games, which use the Simple Direct Medial Layer library. 

My specific role in the project was to implement an effective method to build and package the necessary game assets, as well as libraries and frameworks required for the game to run smoothly on iOS and OS X platforms. I accomplished most of this by command line, however, I found a useful feature in Xcode which allows developers to create a run script which will package the apps' dynamically linked libraries.
