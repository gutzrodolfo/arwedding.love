This page will be updated periodically with projects I've worked on independently or have contributed to. 

<h2> RISC vs. CISC </h2>

During the fall 2013 quarter, I worked collabratively with professor Dr. Ernesto Gomez within the School of Computer Science & Engineering at my university to study the effects of RISC and CISC instruction set architures on the energy consumption of contemporary mobile micro-processors. 

Conclusion: Neither instruction set architecture is inherently more or less energy efficient. The significance of the
ISA appears to simply be an engineering design preference aimed at achieving different levels of performance. Significant energy consumption differences between RISC & CISC ISAs are attributed to microarchitecture differences.  

[This]({{ site.url }}/assets/cse595_Fall2013.pdf) is a link to the paper I presented with my findings during the fall 2013 quarter.

<h2> SDL Implementation on iOS and OSX </h2>

During the spring 2014 quarter, I worked extensively with professor Dr. David Turner on the implementation and packaging for release of cross-platform games, which use the Simple Direct Medial Layer library. 

My specific role in the project was to build and package the correct static and dynamic SDL libraries.
